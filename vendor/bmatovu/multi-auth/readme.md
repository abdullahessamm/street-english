## Laravel Multi-Authentication Package
This package simplifies multi authentication for your Laravel project. It builds on the default [Laravel authentication](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/authentication) to keep things familiar.

In brief; the package will scaffold all the files you need for creating a custom [**guard**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/authentication#adding-custom-guards), as well as setting it up for authentication.

**Supports:** Laravel versions 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6

### Installation
Since this pacakge builds on default laravel authentication; make sure you've set it up first. [**_Ref_**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/authentication)

`$ composer require bmatovu/multi-auth`

### Register Service Provider 
Only for Laravel versions 5.3 and 5.4. For v5.5 and above; this package's service provider and facade alias will be discovered automatically upon installation.

In `config/app.php`
```
'providers' => array(
    // ...
   Bmatovu\MultiAuth\MultiAuthServiceProvider::class,
),
```

**Register Alias** 
In `config/app.php`
```
'aliases' => [
    // ...
    'MultiAuth' => Bmatovu\MultiAuth\MultiAuth::class,
],
```

If you've cached your configurations, you need to run;
`$ php artisan config:cache`

### Install Package
`$ php artisan multi-auth:install {guard}`

Default guard is named: `admin` be sure to use a name that suits your needs.
This command will scaffold configurations, controllers, middleware, migrations, models, routes, and views; to get you started.
